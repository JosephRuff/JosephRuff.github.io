										<b>Python / VTK Medical Imaging: </b>While searching for full time work I’ve volunteered to work on a medical imaging project at UCLH. The software I’ve written visualises the difference between two 3D scans by using VTK to calculate the distance between each cell in the scans. The distance of cells is then mapped to a colour table and the colour of each cell is coloured accordingly. The purpose of this software is to visualise differences, in this case growth, between the two scans.

Work involved using R with packages like Tidyverse and ggplot to extract information from HCA’s patient data, and then to produce reports on my findings, as well as working on and improving their existing ETL pipelines. One of these projects was to look into how quickly nurses respond to calls on the different floors, and on different shifts. Another involved finding duplicate patient records within the database, and identifying which departments were submitting the duplicates.

									<h3>
										HCA Healthcare call bell response audit: 
									</h3>
									<p class="text-block">
										London bridge hospital, which is run by HCA Healthcare UK, has a call bell system in place for patients to request assistance from staff. The aim of the call bells is to reduce the chance of an accident that may be caused by a patient trying to stand up and get something by themselves. 
									</p>
									<p class="text-block">
										For this project I was given a csv file containing data on a month's worth of call bells (over 8000 entries), and was tasked with seeing what information I could extract. The csv contained columns for: the area of the hospital, the room, the time of the call, the date of the call, and the response time. 
									</p>
									<p class="text-block">
										Using R Studio, with Tidyverse and ggplot, I produced a report containing several plots. This included: a set of ecdf plots, indicating the performance against KPI (response time of &lt;120 seconds), for each individual floor of the hospital; a box plot indicating the response time distribution by shift; a box plot and bar plot indicating call volume against response time; the distribution of calls over 5 mins, for every floor as well as the hospital as a whole; and a table of summary statistics for every floor and the hospital as a whole, including mean, median and range of the call durations, as well as the busiest hours of each floor (which hour has the highest call volume). Demonstrated ability to find and visualise relevant and useful information, as well as learn an unfamiliar programming language for the purposes of statistical computing.

									<h3>
										Radiation Protection Project: 
									</h3>
									<p class="text-block">
										At UCLH I assisted in the development of a radiation protection project that assisted physicists in determining the appropriate level of radiation shielding in the various walls and doors of a scanner room. Typically these equations are done by hand and the physicist must use a 2D floor plan and knowledge of where the radiation sources are within the room to calculate the necessary level of shielding in each door and wall, to prevent unnecessary exposure. Where these calculations become complex is when you factor in that the intensity and location of a source of radiation will change, in addition to the various doors being opened and closed, throughout the scanning process. 
									</p>
									<p class="text-block">
										This project aimed to assist in this process by allowing the user to generate a digital 2D floor plan, set the various levels of shielding within each wall and door of the room, and then place radiation sources of varying intensities, at different locations within the room. The program would then generate an overlay, displaying the level of radiation intensity at each point in the room by applying a colour gradient to it. This produced a heatmap showing the levels of radiation in all the rooms at all points. 
									</p>
									<p class="text-block">
										This was written in Java, and demonstrated my ability to work within a multidisciplinary environment.

									<h3>
										My final year project: 
									</h3>
									<p class="text-block">
										Tasked with writing a program to visualise Conway’s Game of Life and other Cellular Automata. Designed for usage at departmental recruitment events. Program had to be visually appealing and enable users to better understand cellular automata. 
									</p>
									<p class="text-block">
										Finished program was written in Java to facilitate usage across multiple operating systems. Program features allowed the user to pause, play, adjust speed, and manually go back and forward through each individual generation in the simulation. Other features allowed the user to visualise the changes that occurred in between generations and keep track of the number of living and dead cells. Simulations could be saved and loaded and the rules to Conway's Game of Life were not hard coded and could be changed in order to simulate other lifelike cellular automata. Demonstrated ability to learn an unfamiliar programming language, as well as program a functional animation engine.

										A level project:

									<p class="text-block">
										Was a continuation of my year 12 work experience at UCLH. The task was to complete a timetable coded in python and run on a Raspberry Pi computer. Program appointment information from a text file and then displayed them on screen in order of time. I made use of the pygame library to display text onto a screen and read from and write to a text file to get and store appointment information.
									</p>
									<p class="text-block">
